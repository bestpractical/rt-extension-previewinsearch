NAME
    RT::Extension::PreviewInSearch - preview tickets right from search
    results page

DESCRIPTION
    RT's query builder (the ticket search interface) allows you to customize
    all of the columns that show up in search results, so you can usually
    customize a search and get all of the ticket metadata you need displayed
    on the search results page (e.g., current status, queue, owner, etc.).
    But sometimes you also need to see something from the history when you
    are looking for a ticket. This extension allows you to view the history
    of tickets at the bottom of the search results page without clicking
    over to the full display ticket page.

    With the extension installed, perform your search, then click anywhere
    in the ticket row in the search results. The history for that ticket
    will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
